                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>Welcome to my small corner of the internet. I am a postdoctoral researcher at the esteemed University of Knowledge, where I spend my days pondering the very fabric of the cosmos and my nights wondering if I remembered to water my plants. My research focuses on the intersection of quantum entanglement and the emergent properties of complex systems. Basically, I try to understand the very, very small to explain the very, very big.</p>
                
                <p>When I'm not wrestling with equations, you can find me exploring ancient hiking trails, attempting to bake the perfect sourdough, or enjoying a <a href="#" class="zesty-link">particularly zesty</a> cup of coffee.</p>

                <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 0.8em; color: #777;">A visual metaphor for my research. Or just a cool picture. You decide.</p>
